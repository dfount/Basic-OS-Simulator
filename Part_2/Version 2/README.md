# **Basic OS Simulator - Part 2: Process Simulation**

## **Project Overview:**
This is the second phase of a simplified operating system simulator. In this part, we focus on representing processes within the system using a `Process` class. The class encapsulates process attributes and behaviors, simulating process execution, state changes, and time management.

## **How to Run:**

1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   g++ -o os_simulator main.cpp process.cpp
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./os_simulator
   ```
