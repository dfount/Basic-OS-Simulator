# Updates

## Version [2] 

### Added Turnaround Time Tracking:
- **What's New**: We’ve added a system to track turnaround times for key processes in the project. This will help keep things running smoothly and show where we might need to optimize.
- **Why**: The goal here is to make sure we have a clear idea of how long things take so we can plan better and react faster when needed.
- **What It Means**: With this in place, we’ll get more accurate reporting and be able to spot any delays or improvements in processing tasks, making everything work more efficiently overall.
